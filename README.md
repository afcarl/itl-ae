### Notebooks
`ITL AE best  log-likelihood` and `ITL AE-Swiss Roll` were the ones used to
generate the results on the paper, the other ones show work in progress not
published yet that you may find interesting.

### Torch version
For torch users, there is an implementation [here](). It does not reproduce all the
results in the paper like this one.
